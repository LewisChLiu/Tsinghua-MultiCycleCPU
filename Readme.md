# Tsinghua-MultiCycleCPUs

### Welcome!

This project was created for Tsinghua EE class, Digital Logic and Processor Foundations.

Based on MIPS, this CPU can run some of its instruction. It can also detect overflow for the instruction add and addi.

To avoid the problem of overflow, please use the instruction addu.
